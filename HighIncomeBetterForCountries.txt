Few people nowadays have a decorous salary and as per their earnings they have prediliction for fine things. On the basis of this people think this is directly proportionate to the country's economy and it is good to raise such bar, where as others think officials should restrain such earnings and put diciplinrary actions to limit the remunerations. In my opinion, no one can hold anyone's growth infact we should inspire and aim similar to achieve such growth. In this essay I will further explain this with some relevant reasons. 

One of the conspicuous reason country should support to have good salary is that the tax collection, the more salary one would have the more tax will be collected for government. And in this way the officials could plan some extra and beneficial services in their  rudamentary phase itself. For instance, in Canada there are numerous of health policies that will save people to broke financially however they are only applicable for people who are paying the tax. Similarly, facilities like highways, insurance, schooling and many varied sectors are flourished using this tax collected fund.

The another aspect is related to a healthy competetion. As per the human tendency, if there are two person out of which one is getting good pay and another getting average pay. Then the other person will automatically try to do better to get the same pay. And in this wealthy competetion the entire environment gets benefit.

To conclude, my opinion would be inclined towards the better salary  as this provides the better country's growth.
