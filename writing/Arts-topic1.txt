As a law abiding citizen of the country one always gets thought about government investments and expenditure on various plans. One may lead to the fact that government may wasting money on arts or they are investing appropriately. But according to me spending money on arts is a rightful and needful requirement, due to the reasons like next generation exposure and maintaing the sacred traditions.

If we do not preserve our arts and culture for upcoming generation, then they would never get exposure of our traditions. And this leads them to follow different country cultures. We would be then realizing, if the government have been invested the respective resources on the arts, then our childern may have not like this. There are many factors which should be adapted by children form their native places. As these helps them in raising them well and be into a good person.

Thinking about next generation is one of the major and serious concerns but we must think about the present situation as well. If we didn't spent time and resources in maintaining our sacred traditions then we are also loosing our ground values. which we need in our day to day activities. like marriage, worship routines, house warmings and many more. .so preserving our sacred traditions in present is also very necessary.

Thus concluding, for our next generations and for us arts plays a very important role as it teaches in many different form.
hence, money spent by governemnt on art is also required as much as they might be needed elsewhere.
